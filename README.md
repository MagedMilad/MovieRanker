# MovieRanker
Movie Ranker is a project in Udacity's Android Developer Which I made from scratch and it was evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer and was graded as "Meet Specifications".

The purpose of this project was to built an app,optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. 

##Features
• Discover the most popular, the highest rated movies

• Save favorite movies but you need internet to access them again :)

• Play trailers

• Read user reviews


##How this work
This app uses The [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to retrieve movies. 
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app Which you can create your own one very easy! from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-EN).
When you get it, just paste it to:  `app/build.gradle`
